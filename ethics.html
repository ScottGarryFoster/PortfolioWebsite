										<h3 style="text-transform: capitalize">ETHICS</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Most people have a concept of ethics in their day to lives whether they be political, moral, or environmental. When considering how I would like to approach my career there are certain aspects of the profession which I could only consider my ethical decisions as a software engineer. These guiding principles are the basis for which the decision I make should stand upon for me to consider the work I produce to be ‘ethical’ at least in my own. These are largely drawn from works in the field from established engineers.
										</p>
									<p>
										As professed by Robert Martin, software engineers rule the world, or rather other people make the rules, and we program those rules. There isn’t much of anything you can do in this society which does not involve a piece of software.
									</p>
									<p>
										This page contains the main ethical pillars I stand by and what they mean to me to ensure my work remains at a high (and ethically just) standard.

									<h2><strong>Articles</strong></h2>
								</header>
								<p style="text-align: right">Main Goals: Education and Growth</p>
								<p>
									My blog attempts to use researched methodologies paired with well known technologies to give solid advice for reader who may be looking to take their game project to the next level. I write about clean code, test driven development and design discipline. The posts are written with one or two pieces of research (generally books) in mind to ensure that the advice given is done so in good faith and where opinions (or punditry) are given they are expressed openly. The content is given as a jumping off point with sources given.
								</p>
								<p>
									Test driven development is a theme among these blog posts generally because in the gaming material models (such as mocking, dependency injection, seams) are used without consideration for the technique (in a lot of tutorials). When approaching any model or technique the importance should be on why the model is used, it’s advantages/disadvantages and the technique itself. Given the material researched before I began writing appeared to lack in this area, I felt my blog had something to offer.
								</p>
								<p>
									General themes of the blog are to be the pillars I stand by for software development, clean, confident, and robust code. Design and documentation also do appear but these lean more heavily on growth and research.

								</header>
								<p>University Submission (1st year)</p>
								<p style="text-align: right">
									Written in SDL in C++ my goal was to recreate the first level of Super Mario Bros. 3 as part of my University course work.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: right">
									The end result was the first level, with working enemies, split screen multiplayer, music/sound and a fully working level editor.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: right">
									I included external controller support for SNES and NES controllers, multiplayer where one player can save the other if needed. Both players can pick up items, fire shells or even complete the level.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: right">
									The level editor has all the blocks included, allows complete customisation of the layout, standard tools such as pencil/eraser and more advanced tools which interact with the functionality of the game such as question mark blocks. Play your game instantly and save them to be included in the main game-play mode.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: right">
									Completed in just over 3 months the project taught me a lot about programming in C++ and invaluable games programming skills.

									<h2><strong>STARSHIP IMPROVISE UNITY C#</strong></h2>
								</header>
								<p style="text-align: right">University Submission (2nd year)</p>
								<p>
									As part of my (BSc) Games Development at Staffordshire university we were tasked with producing a Tower Defence game, designing it first, producing a marketing plan and finally creating the product or something like it.
								</p>
								<p>
									I put my heart and soul into something which looks like it could be a released game I'll be there are some corners cut to produce the result. Star-ship Improvise has two levels with four enemies of two different types, a star pathfinding separately between the types, towers which shoot or affect enemies in directly and save games.
								</p>
								<p>
									The game has within it the beginnings of a story, a soundtrack which progressively gets more upbeat as the waves progress, a world map screen, a level/tower/upgrade screen which has a in world preview of what you’re looking at and the game saves your progress automatically.
								</p>
								<p>
									The project taught me the idea of scaling down a project to get the core system instead of designing a much bigger project meant for multiple people. Additionally, although the system I built is solid, I did end up having to plug a few holes regarding enemies and level management which I wouldn’t have been happy releasing.

									<h2><strong>PACMAN RECREATION IN C++</strong></h2>
								</header>
								<p>University Submission (1st year)</p>
								<p style="text-align: right">
									Using a framework based on OpenGL I recreated Pacman as part of my university course. It has Pacman, Ms. Pacman and some original levels, with recreated graphics and sound, I hope this recreation can live up-to the original.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: right">
									Considering this was my first project I feel the results are rather nice. I had a completed Pacman game with my own graphics and music without C++ knowledge. The levels load from file which is no small feat. and the overall quality of the product is impressive.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: right">
									Something I wanted in here from the start was A star path-finding. This is a technique of path-finding aiming to find the shortest route between two points. This system in my game works and even works through the screen wraps.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: right">
									There's a lot to improved, this was my first project using C++ from the ground up and overall it needs a clean up. I would say everything as a whole needs to be rethought up in terms of C++, in terms of polymorphism and a pointer based system.								</p>

									<h2><strong>NEVER ENDING SCROLLY UNITY/C#</strong></h2>
								</header>
								<p style="text-align: right">Game Jam (2021)</p>
								<p>
									The goal of this game is to continually clear screens and move south as a boredom (colourlessness) moves down the screen. It has enemies with a basic AI (enemies get bored of you), you gain heart containers the more health you gain and the levels are procedurally generated getting harder as you move between worlds.
								</p>
								<p>
									Never ending scrolly took roughly 36 hours to complete over three days. The goal over that short period of time was to have animations, a basic world shader and to make something playable whatever. The core mechanic I discovered ended up being rather enjoyable and integrated elements of my game’s technology project, procedural generation, with the levels having elements of random generation and difficulty.
								</p>
								<p>
									Game Jam games are generally about figuring out what can be done in a short period of time. One lesson learned from this project was just how quickly I can get a basic game running with a decent amount of polish. A large weakness however is that I find it rather difficult to code in a messy way which in some scenarios is a necessary skill. Occasionally one does need to code in a less organised way but still in a somewhat robust way. Understanding time management and items in design such as difficulty take much longer to test and tweak is something which needs continual improvement.
