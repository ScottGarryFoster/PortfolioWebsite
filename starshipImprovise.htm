                                This project was split in to three sections as this was the first “original” game idea we had to implement during my University course, design, marketing and product. The design I felt I put a lot of effort into and enjoyed the vast majority of the exercise. Once I had the idea clear in my head I able to produce a lot of content for the core gameplay and story design of the product. The marketing was more tricky and attempting to not resort to simply advertising as a plan required more research than I excepted.<br />
                                <br />
The end product was of a good quality but there are little things which bug me which I know with enough time I could get rid of. Something I found particularly difficult was ray casting and mouse clicking with UI able to follow the camera. What I ended up with was a system which works however if you move the camera as you’re using the UI the positioning changes such that it will falsely believe you’ve hovered and exited the elements. <br />
<br />
Within the actual levels there are also some plugs I had to put into place such as enemies not deleting themselves but then the connection being broken with the level manager. These bugs and others seem to be a lack of system planning as a whole and experience within the engine. I’ve learned a lot from my time using the engine and so would be confident I could create a more robust system next time.

                                Written in SDL in C++ my goal was to recreate the first level of Super Mario Bros. 3 as part of my University course work.<br/>
<br/>
The end result was the first level, with working enemies, split screen multiplayer, music/sound and a fully working level editor.<br/>
<br/>
I included external controller support for SNES and NES controllers, multiplayer where one player can save the other if needed. Both players can pick up items, fire shells or even complete the level.<br/>
<br/>
The level editor has all the blocks included, allows complete customisation of the layout, standard tools such as pencil/eraser and more advanced tools which interact with the functionality of the game such as question mark blocks. Play your game instantly and save them to be included in the main game-play mode.<br/>
<br/>
Completed in just over 3 months the project taught me a lot about programming in C++ and invaluable games programming skills.

                                As part of my (BSc) Games Development at Staffordshire university we were tasked with producing a Tower Defence game, designing it first, producing a marketing plan and finally creating the product or something like it.<br />
<br />
I put my heart and soul into something which looks like it could be a released game I'll be there are some corners cut to produce the result. Star-ship Improvise has two levels with four enemies of two different types, a star pathfinding separately between the types, towers which shoot or affect enemies in directly and save games.<br />
<br />
The game has within it the beginnings of a story, a soundtrack which progressively gets more upbeat as the waves progress, a world map screen, a level/tower/upgrade screen which has a in world preview of what you’re looking at and the game saves your progress automatically.<br />
<br />
The project taught me the idea of scaling down a project to get the core system instead of designing a much bigger project meant for multiple people. Additionally, although the system I built is solid, I did end up having to plug a few holes regarding enemies and level management which I wouldn’t have been happy releasing.

                                Using a frame work based on OpenGL I recreated Pacman as part of my university course. It has Pacman, Ms. Pacman and some original levels, with recreated graphics and sound, I hope this recreation can live up-to the original.<br />
<br />
Considering this was my first project I feel the results are rather nice. I had a completed Pacman game with my own graphics and music without C++ knowledge. The levels load from file which is no small feat. and the overall quality of the product is impressive.<br />
<br />
Something I wanted in here from the start was A star path-finding. This is a technique of path-finding aiming to find the shortest route between two points. This system in my game works and even works through the screen wraps.<br />
<br />
There's a lot to improved, this was my first project using C++ from the ground up and overall it needs a clean up. I would say everything as a whole needs to be rethought up in terms of C++, in terms of polymorphism and a pointer based system.

                                I started a project simply code named “Project-RPG” which is an attempt to create some mechanics which would fit nicely into an RPG.<br/>
<br/>
I’ve implemented some ray casting with the camera so that it finds the player, some basic animal AI, buildings which work inside with the camera and door, a tree which can be chopped down and the beginnings of an inventory system.<br/>
<br/>
The camera is by no means perfect and although it will zoom in, I need a more reactive system, one which not only finds the player but also attempts to find the highest zoom level it can. Also I could do with adding lerps in the movement.<br/>
<br/>
The animal AI I’m rather happy with even though it’s basic. I think extending that script into something I could apply to more things would be really nice.<br/>
<br/>
The buildings are fine however I’m going to need to look into a better way to have buildings work. This could be by taking control away from the player when entering/leaving and this would make doing such a little less janky. Also I need some UI for the door control.
